# HSHomeProduct

**This is a demo project made for portfolio purposes.**

The task of this personal project was to redesign the homepage of the HS website using React & Bootstrap 5 (SASS).

There is a "quick find" area to help the customer find cover, ideally the customer would use the dropdowns to refine their search & then be taken to some kind of comparison page where they can select a product close to their requirements. However, for the purposes of the demo, I have disabled most options and upon clicking search, you are taken to one of the product pages. I hope to expand on this one day, given time.

Please note: The data is public, however, it was blocked by CORS-policy on use, hence why it has been copied to a JSON database instead.

To run the project, please be sure to have the following installed:

Bootstrap:

`npm install sass` & `npm install bootstrap`

To "watch" the database, open a new terminal and type

`npx json-server src/data/db.json --port 8000`

Thank you
